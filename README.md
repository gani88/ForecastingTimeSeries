This is basically my learning progress on Forecasting using Time Series and also this can be use as my project/portofolio. This learning is based from kaggle (the code, project, dataset) and I want to summarize all my learning progress in this repo. Guided by the wealth of resources available on Kaggle – including code snippets, complete projects, and diverse datasets – this repository stands as a comprehensive summary of my learning endeavors.

In my pursuit of mastering Time Series Forecasting, I've engaged with a myriad of concepts that span the spectrum from fundamental principles to advanced methodologies. Kaggle's platform has been a cornerstone, providing not just theoretical understanding but practical insights garnered from real-world projects and challenges.
